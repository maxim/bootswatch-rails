# bootswatch-rails

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/bootswatch-rails.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/bootswatch-rails)

This gem is meant to be used with
[bootstrap-sass](https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass). It gives
you complete scss versions of [bootswatches](http://bootswatch.com) for use in
your Rails asset pipeline, just like bootstrap-sass gives you scss version of
bootstrap itself.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile, in assets group:

    gem 'bootswatch-rails'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

When using bootstrap-sass, it's recommended to avoid sprockets in your
stylesheets. In order to do that you simply rename your `application.css` file
to `application.css.scss`, remove all sprockets comments, and instead use sass
`@import` commands. These commands are smart enough to fully support asset
pipeline load paths, thanks to `sass-rails` gem.

Here's approximately how your `application.css.scss` file should look like,
considering that you're using
[bootstrap-sass](https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass).

    // Example using 'Cerulean' bootswatch
    //
    // First import cerulean variables
    @import "bootswatch/cerulean/variables";

    // Then bootstrap itself
    @import "bootstrap";

    // Bootstrap body padding for fixed navbar
    body { padding-top: 60px; }

    // And finally bootswatch style itself
    @import "bootswatch/cerulean/bootswatch";

    // Whatever application styles you have go last
    @import "base";

### Overriding bootswatch variables

Since version 3.1 it's possible to override variables.

    // First set or import your overrides
    $textColor: #000;

    // Then load variables
    @import "bootswatch/journal/variables";

    // Then the rest as shown above...

Please see [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/maxim/bootswatch-rails/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more detail. (Dont change the scss files by hand, use the converter and rearranger first, and make your changes in those if possible)


#### Note about converter
I am trying to automate this project as much as possible, so I wrote a script
that does most of the work converting less to scss. If you want to contribute a
fix that's easily automatable and you know ruby, please add a processor to the
converter.
